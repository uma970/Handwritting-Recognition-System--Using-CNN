# Handwritting-Recognition-System
This project focuses on developing a Handwriting Recognition System using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to accurately recognize and classify handwritten text. The system is designed to process handwritten characters and convert them into digital text, improving accessibility and automation in various fields like education, healthcare, and assistive technology.

Key Features:
Deep Learning Model: Implemented a CNN-based architecture to recognize handwritten text from images.
Preprocessing Techniques: Used image processing methods such as grayscale conversion, noise reduction, and binarization to improve recognition accuracy.
Model Training & Evaluation: Optimized the CNN model using TensorFlow/Keras, fine-tuning hyperparameters for better performance.
Real-time Recognition: Integrated image input from scanned documents or camera feeds for real-time handwriting recognition.

Technologies Used:
Deep Learning Frameworks: TensorFlow, Keras, PyTorch
Programming Languages: Python
Libraries: OpenCV, NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib
Data Processing Tools: Image Augmentation, Feature Extraction
